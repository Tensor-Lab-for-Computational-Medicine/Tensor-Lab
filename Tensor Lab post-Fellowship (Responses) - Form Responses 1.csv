This fellowship strengthened that interest and helped me focus my career goals more clearly toward healthcare and AI-driven research.,"The guidance from Dr. Snow, Laura, and Aaron greatly helped me throughout the Tensor Lab program. Their support and feedback improved my research skills and kept me on track. I wouldn’t have reached the final goal of my project without their help.","I didn’t face many challenges during the fellowship. The communication within our group was excellent, and everything went smoothly throughout the project.","I don’t think much needs to be changed, the fellowship was well organized and ran smoothly.",
11/7/2025 21:43:29,Ashwin Muralidharan,3,About the same,Increased significantly,Increased significantly,Much better than before,"Because I was not aiming for a medical-adjacent career during the fellowship, it did not change my career interests. However, it gave me valuable skills in conducting LLM-related research and application development, which I carried into my current job. See other answers for more.","Tensor Lab helped me understand how to conceptualize, propose, and develop applications for LLMs that also require significant domain knowledge. As a CS graduate, I did not have a medical background entering the fellowship, so I learned many valuable lessons about communicating my technical knowledge and receiving project requirements and feedback from domain experts outside my field. Although my current career is not adjacent to medicine, these skills have been deeply helpful to me. I also appreciated the chance to contribute to an open-source medical project that could provide tangible benefits to ER students; this is not an opportunity common to all CS research. ",The fellowship ran very smoothly for me. I did not see significant barriers in developing my project.,"I would have more regular meetings between the whole cohort, as well as a more structured system for interacting with faculty mentors.

I'd rather prefer fellows can also interact with each other because networking is specially important for us,"After increasing my field of view, I'd be glad more specialists and med students would join just to give the fellowship even more options that might fit with other research pipelines",
11/8/2025 19:56:02,Jialong Wu,2,Much more effective,Increased somewhat,Increased somewhat,Much better than before,"I've always been driven to pursue AI for Science, particularly within the biochemistry domain. This fellowship, especially through the guidance of our Med Mentor, profoundly influenced my approach. I gained exposure to the real-world challenges and pressing questions from a clinical perspective. This experience trained me to first understand problems from the mentor's viewpoint and then address them with a Computer Science lens. I believe this has significantly broadened my research horizons and refined my problem-solving process. Crucially, it showed me a greater number of truly meaningful and impactful challenges that combine both fields. Furthermore, as I prepare for my PhD applications, this experience has been invaluable in clearly defining my research direction and positioning myself within this interdisciplinary area.","The mentorship during the Tensor Lab program has been transformative for my research development. As I see it, the combination of a medical perspective with a Computer Science  background within the team is crucial for effective collaboration. This dynamic taught me how to better identify and frame real-world problems by first understanding them from a clinical context, and then tackling them with a robust CS approach. This process of integrating two distinct professional viewpoints has significantly broadened my scientific outlook and allowed me to focus on challenges that are truly meaningful and impactful.","I found the fellowship structure to be highly effective overall.  The main challenge we encountered was primarily related to coordination and project pacing during the summer months. Specifically, maintaining a synchronized research rhythm was demanding, given that everyone was juggling their own independent schedules and summer plans.  Effectively managing and linking the diverse research progress of each team member to ensure overall project cohesion and momentum required significant and ongoing communication and collaboration. This challenge underscored the importance of proactive scheduling and agile coordination in interdisciplinary team science.","I am very grateful for the opportunity to have been part of the Tensor Lab, and I believe the fellowship is highly meaningful and impactful. If the program structure remains similar in the future, my primary suggestion for improvement would be to provide a more explicit and granular timeline at the outset. This clearer roadmap would help participating team members:Improve Execution: Provide better guidance for execution and allow members to maintain strong momentum.Define Milestones: Ensure every member clearly understands the deliverables and specific tasks required for each phase of the research. I believe this would serve as a more definite guidance and greatly enhance team efficiency, especially when participants are managing independent summer schedules.","I would like to sincerely thank everyone involved in founding and running the Tensor Lab program.  A huge appreciation goes out to all the dedicated Professors and Med Mentors for generously dedicating their time and expertise. This initiative is extremely meaningful and impactful—please continue this vital work!  If there is anything at all I can do to help or contribute in the future, please do not hesitate to reach out."
11/9/2025 23:02:44,Shravya Dasu,0,N/A - No prior research experience,This was a transformative skill gain for me,Increased somewhat,Somewhat better,Through this fellowship I got to work on an interesting project. I got interesting research work experience. I think as of now my career trajectory is the same - going into corporate.,Through this fellowship I got the chance to work on a project in a domain I haven't really experimented with. The mentorship from Griff really helped push the project in the right direction and I am thankful for his support. The team at tensor lab was supportive throughout the fellowship and tried their best to make it interactive and fun. This fellowship did add a valuable project to my portfolio.,The most significant challenge I faced during the fellowship was limited availability of computational resources. I did my data analysis on CPU and used the minimal limited GPU available on Colab to run my model. This severely limited my ability to experiment with my code and improve it. , In one of the tasks I was assigned to review the project  proposal and provide feedback for one fellow and then later I was asked to do the same for another fellow. To me it seemed like some of the fellows dropped out in between. So I guess something could be done to avoid fellows from dropping out which results in others doing extra work.,I think that the Tensor Lab initiative was an interesting and helpful one and I would like to see it succeed in the future. There is plenty of opportunity for collaboration. I think that if I had more time and resources in hand I could have invested more but I did the best with what I had.
